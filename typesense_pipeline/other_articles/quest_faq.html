    What is a Quest?
    A Quest is a quiz or series of quizzes that help you grow the knowledge and skills you need to safely navigate Web3. Each time you complete a quiz, you'll receive a Proof-of-Knowledge NFT.
    Quests can be tailored to the needs of Web3 communities and brands, providing a high-quality onboarding experience, essential security knowledge and rewards for the members.
    What is a crypto wallet?
    Your wallet holds and secures your private keys and allows you to interact with different Web3 platforms.
    Connecting your crypto wallet to Ledger Quest is like logging in but without sharing any of your data. Your wallet also enables you to collect PoK NFTs at the address you used to log in.
    What are NFTs?
    NFTs, which stand for non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that live blockchain. They differ from fungible tokens like coins or tokens, which are identical to each other. Today, NFTs can be used to create a digital certificate that represents a unique asset, such as art, music, certificates, etc.
    What is a PoK NFT?
    Proof-of-Knowledge NFTs represent immutable proof of your Web3 expertise. They come in different forms and can unlock IRL & metaverse perks. With PoK NFTs, you can build a unique collection that keeps track of your learning progress as you make your way to becoming a Web3 expert.
    How do I participate in a Quest?
    Here's how to get started:
    1. On the homepage, go to the navigation bar and click Quests.
    2. Check if you're eligible for your chosen Quest. Some of the Quests are token-gated. That means you'll need to connect or sign a message with your crypto wallet, proving ownership of a certain NFT.
    3. After finding your Quest, click Connect Wallet.
    4. Select the ETH/MATIC address where you want to receive your PoK NFT.
    5. Click Start a Quest.
    That's it, you’re all set to begin your journey.
    Note: Ledger Quest runs on Polygon. You can connect with your Ethereum account using Ledger + MetaMask (WebHID), and it will automatically switch networks for you. If you're using Ledger Live, you need to install the Polygon app on your Ledger device. Alternatively, you can also use only metamask or any web3 browser integrated wallets.
    How do I set up a MetaMask wallet?
    MetaMask is a software wallet used to interact with Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. It allows you to access your accounts via a browser extension or mobile app. Here you can find the tutorial on how to set up MetaMask and use it with Ledger.
    Can I use my Ledger wallet to participate in Quests?
    Absolutely. Connect your Ledger device to MetaMask and start Questing. Your private keys remain secure in your Ledger wallet.
    Can anyone participate in Quests?
    If your goal is to learn about Web3, Ledger’s Academy Quest has everything you need. However, be aware that some Quests (Community Quest/Partner Quest) are exclusive to certain communities; this means you’ll need to have a specific NFT in your wallet to pass the token gate.
    What are token gated Quests?
    Token gated quests are created for specific communities. You will need to connect or sign a message with your crypto wallet, proving ownership of a certain NFT in order to participate in the quest.
    How do I claim my PoK NFT reward?
    You’ll know you’ve crushed your Quest when you see Success on the screen. Click Claim and a PoK NFT will land straight in your wallet.
    Do I have to pay fees to mint my NFT?
    Ledger takes care of the minting fees. Enjoy your NFT, you earned it fairly.
    How can I view my PoK NFT?
    If you’re using a Ledger Nano, you’ll be able to visualize your NFT within the Ledger Live interface.
    You can also view it by heading over to secondary marketplaces such as Rarible/OpenSea and connecting your wallet.
    What rights do I have over my PoK NFTs?
    PoK NFTs are a reward for completing a Quest. They validate your knowledge and provide IRL & metaverse perks. To learn more about the rights over your PoK NFT, check out our terms and conditions.
    Are PoK NFTs transferable?
    A PoK NFT is non-transferable—nobody can own it except the person who earned it.
    You may be able to set a price for your NFT on secondary marketplaces and people can make offers to it. However, actual transactions will not get through due restrictions set up in our smart contract.
