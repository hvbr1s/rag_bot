    If a user reports losing or cannot retrieve their secret recovery phrase but still has PIN access to their Ledger device, advise them to immediately transfer funds from the accounts that are no longer backed up. 
    Then, guide them to create a new recovery phrase and set up new accounts in Ledger Live with their Ledger device.
