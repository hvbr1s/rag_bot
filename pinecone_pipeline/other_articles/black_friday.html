    This article addresses the most frequently asked questions about Ledger's Black Friday (BF) 2023 sale.

    1- When is the sale happening?
    The Black Friday sale begins on Monday, November 20th and continues through Monday, November 27th, 2023. Please note, the sale does not include Tuesday, November 28th, 2023.

    2- Can I apply the promotion to an order I placed before Black Friday began?
    We cannot retroactively apply the Black Friday promotion to orders placed before Monday November 27th, 2023. However, if you ordered before Black Friday and received your package within the last 14 days, you can return it for a refund via the My Order page at my-order.ledger.com and then reorder using the Black Friday promotion. 

    3- I bought a Backup or a Family pack/bundle during Black Friday, but I did not receive the promotional gift card. Why not?
    The Black Friday promotion does not cover bundle offers like the Backup pack or the Family pack, except for the Nano Duo bundle. The Black Friday deal applies only to individual black Ledger devices or the special Black Friday Nano Duo bundle available at: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-duo

    4- Are colored Ledger devices part of the promotion?
    No, colored Ledger devices (Nano S Plus and Nano X) are not included in the Black Friday deals. Deals only apply to black devices.

    5- I used a referral link to purchase but didn't get the $10 gift card. Why?
    The Refer-a-Friend gift card cannot be combined with the Black Friday promotion. However, you can still earn rewards if your friends buy individual devices using your referral link during the sale.

    6- I made a Black Friday purchase but did not receive the gift card. Why?

    Please ensure the following:

    a. Purchase Date and Time: Verify that your purchase was made during the Black Friday period, which is from Monday, November 20th to Monday, November 27th, 2023
    b. Eligible Products: Confirm that your purchase included individual black Ledger Nano S Plus, Nano X devices, or the special Nano Duo bundle. Please note that regular packs/bundles or colored Ledger Nano devices do not qualify for the Black Friday promotion.
    c. Excluded Accessories: Be aware that accessories such as the Cryptosteel, Billfold, and CryptotagZeus are not part of this offer.
    d. Options for Ineligible Orders: If your order does not qualify for the Black Friday promotion, you have the opportunity to cancel it within 14 days and place a new order that meets the eligibility criteria. For order cancellation, visit the My Order page at my-order.ledger.com.

    If your order meets all the above conditions and you still haven't received your gift card, please reach out to Ledger Support at https://support.ledger.com/ for further assistance.

    7- I cannot find the promotional scratch card in the Ledger box.
    That is expected. The Black Friday gist card is a physical card sent in a separate envelope with your order, not inside the Ledger box itself. We will send one envelope for each eligible item, with a limit of five items per order.

    8- How do I use the promotional Black Friday card?
    Simply scratch off the card to reveal a promotional code. Then, navigate to the Refer a Friend (RAF) app found in the 'Discover' section of Ledger Live. There, you can redeem your code and claim your promotional Bitcoin (BTC). 30 days after having redeemed your code, you will need to claim your Bitcoin (BTC) in your Refer-a-friend account and provide a Bitcoin Address. When selecting the option to claim your Reward you can select one of the Bitcoin Addresses proposed or enter a new one.
 
    9 I want to return my Black Friday order. Can I get a refund?
    You have 14 days from the date of delivery to return your order and get a full refund. Keep in mind that the unscratched Black Friday gift card needs to be returned as well.
