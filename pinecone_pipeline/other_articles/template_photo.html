        <p class="question">
            is it safe to take a picture of your recovery phrase?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            No, it is not safe to take a picture of your recovery phrase. Your
            smartphone could be compromised, and the picture could get
            automatically uploaded to your cloud storage. This could potentially
            expose your recovery phrase to unauthorized individuals. Always keep
            your recovery phrase offline and secure. For more information on how
            to protect your recovery phrase, you can visit this link: </p>
