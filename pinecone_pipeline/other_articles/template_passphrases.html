        <p class="question">
            What is a passphrase?
            How do passphrases work?
            How do I set up a passphrase?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            "A passphrase is an optional security feature that provides an extra
            layer of security to your crypto accounts. We recommend that you
            carefully read our article and watch the video on how to set up a
            passphrase before proceeding.

            It's important to note that the recovery phrase and passphrase
            functionalities provide different security setups that you can
            customize according to your personal situation. We advise you not to
            overcomplicate things, and to choose a security setup that you are
            confident in.

            Adding a passphrase is kind of like adding a password to your
            24-word recovery phrase, which then gives access to a whole new set
            of accounts. This helps protect your crypto assets in case your
            recovery phase is compromised. Each passphrase unlocks a unique set
            of accounts, and you can use as many passphrases as you like.

            You may often hear this referred to as the ""25th Word,"" but a passphrase can actually be as long as you'd like it to be.  You are not limited to just 1 extra word."
