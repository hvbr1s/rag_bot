    How to navigate this list
    To search the list, press Ctrl+F on your keyboard to activate the search tool, and then search the list by name, ticker or smart contract address. For optimal accuracy when searching for tokens, we recommend using the smart contract address as your search criteria.
    This list consists of both supported coins and tokens. Learn more about the difference.
    Token support is chain specific. For example, USDC is supported on multiple EVM chains, like Ethereum and Polygon, but not on Cardano. So, when searching a token, be sure that the token name is listed in line with the specific network you're interested in holding them on.
