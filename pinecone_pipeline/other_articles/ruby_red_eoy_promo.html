If you ordered before the promotion and received your package within the last 14 days, you can return it for a refund via the My Order page at my-order.ledger.com and then place a new order for a Ruby Red Nano device using the promotional discount.

    4- How Does the Ruby Red Promotion Work?
    The promotion offers a 20% discount at checkout for any purchase of a Ruby Red Nano X, Ruby Red Nano S Plus, or the Ledger Nano Ruby Duo bundle.

The promotion will be featured on ledger.com and at participating resellers and is valid while Ruby Red Nano devices stocks last.
