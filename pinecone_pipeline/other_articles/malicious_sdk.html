    On December 14 2023, we identified and removed a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit. 
    A genuine version was pushed to replace the malicious file the same day (December 14, 2023)
    Your Ledger device and Ledger Live was not hacked and were never compromised or affected by the exploit because Ledger Connect Kit is only used by third-party dApps and wallets and never installed in your Ledger device or Ledger Live.
    The dApps located in the Discover section of Ledger Live were never affected either.
    The issue strictly impacted third-party services and dapps outside of Ledger Live, and it has since been fixed.
    Nothing needs to be done on your end, you are safe to resume using your Ledger device as normal.
    In situation like these, it's crucial to watch out for phishing scams posing as Ledger or Ledger Support on Social media. 
    Remember, never share your 24-word Secret Recovery Phrase with anyone, including Ledger, and avoid typing it into any apps or websites. 
    Anyone requesting this phrase is attempting to scam you.
